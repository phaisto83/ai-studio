Cohen developed AARON with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. In its primitive form, AARON created simple black and white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint. Cohen designed AARON to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.<sup><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence_art#cite_note-:2-3\">[3]<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since their design in 2014,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Generative_adversarial_networks\">generative adversarial networks<\/a>&nbsp;(GANs) are often used by AI artists. This system uses a &#8220;generator&#8221; to create new images and a &#8220;discriminator&#8221; to decide which created images are considered successful. More recent models use&nbsp;<em>Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network and Contrastive Language\u2013Image Pre-training<\/em>&nbsp;(VQGAN+CLIP).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several programs made by large companies use AI to generate a variety of images based on various&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prompt_engineering\">text prompts<\/a>. They include&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenAI\">OpenAI&#8217;s<\/a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DALL-E\">DALL-E<\/a>&nbsp;which released a series of images in January 2021,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Google_Brain\">Google Brain&#8217;s<\/a>&nbsp;Imagen and Parti which was announced in May 2022 and Microsofts&#8217; NUWA-Infinity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many other AI art generation programs including simple consumer-facing mobile apps and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Jupyter\">Jupyter<\/a>&nbsp;notebooks that require powerful&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/GPUs\">GPUs<\/a>&nbsp;to run effectively.
